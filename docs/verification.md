# Verification Strategy

## Overview
Verification is performed using the **RISC-V Architectural Test Framework (RISCOF)**. This ensures that the core complies with the unprivileged ISA specification.

## Methodology
The verification process involves comparing the signature generated by the Design Under Test (DUT) against the signature generated by a Golden Reference Model (Spike).

### DUT Plugin
The DUT plugin (`verification/compliance/riscof_riscv_cpu.py`) handles:
...
## Running Tests
To execute the compliance suite:

```bash
./verification/run_compliance.sh
```

This script:
1.  Sets up the python environment.
2.  Runs `riscof` with the configured `config.ini`.
3.  Generates an HTML report in `verification/riscof_work/report.html`.

## Passing Criteria
A test is considered passed if and only if the signature generated by the DUT matches the signature generated by Spike bit-for-bit.
