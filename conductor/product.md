# Product Definition

## Initial Concept
To build a fully verified, 5-stage pipelined RISC-V processor (RV32I) implemented in SystemVerilog.

## Vision
To demonstrate a deep understanding of computer architecture by delivering a synthesizable, 5-stage pipelined CPU in SystemVerilog. The project serves as a high-quality portfolio piece, showcasing not just a working core, but a professional-grade engineering process—including rigorous verification, FPGA deployment, and exceptional documentation.

## Target Audience
- **Recruiters & Hiring Managers:** The primary audience. The project is structured to serve as concrete proof of skills in digital design, verification, and system integration.
- **Professors & Academic Evaluators:** To verify the implementation against architectural principles and theoretical correctness.
- **Peers & Students:** As a reference implementation for learning RISC-V architecture and pipeline design.

## Key Features & Goals
- **Core Implementation (Completed):** A synthesizable 5-stage pipelined RV32I core running on PYNQ-Z2 FPGA.
- **Verification & Compliance:** Ensure strict adherence to the RISC-V specification using the RISCOF framework.
- **Code Quality:** Establish and enforce strict code formatting and style standards across all SystemVerilog files.
- **Strategic Documentation Engineering:** Professional-grade documentation following a multi-audience approach with high-fidelity visuals (Draw.io, WaveDrom) and explicit theoretical mapping to Patterson & Hennessy.
- **Portfolio Presentation:** Deploy documentation as a polished GitHub Pages site to maximize accessibility and impact.
- **Performance Metrics:** Define and measure key metrics (e.g., FMax, resource utilization, IPC) that demonstrate engineering rigor.
